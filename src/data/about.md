# Intro

 I'm a web3 full stack developer, join this industry since 2018. I built a venture dao protocol from 0 to 1, anyone can summon a venture dao by one-click. By using this venture-dao you can raising crypto fund for new project. Currently I work at DAOSquare. Before DAOSquare I worked for blockchain department of BAONENG group, BitConch as blockchain engineer. In my spare time, I enjoy investing in crypto. I am particularly interested in web3 projects with vision. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
